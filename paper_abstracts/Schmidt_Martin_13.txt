Title:
Exploiting Parallelism in Coalgebraic Logic Programming
Abstract: We present a parallel implementation of Coalgebraic Logic Programming (CoALP)
in the programming language Go. CoALP was initially introduced to reflect
coalgebraic semantics of logic programming, with coalgebraic derivation
algorithm featuring both corecursion and parallelism. Here, we discuss how the
coalgebraic semantics influenced our parallel implementation of logic
programming.
