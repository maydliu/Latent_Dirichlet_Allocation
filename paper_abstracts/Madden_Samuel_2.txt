Title:
Weld: Rethinking the Interface Between Data-Intensive Applications
Abstract: Data analytics applications combine multiple functions from different
libraries and frameworks. Even when each function is optimized in isolation,
the performance of the combined application can be an order of magnitude below
hardware limits due to extensive data movement across these functions. To
address this problem, we propose Weld, a new interface between data-intensive
libraries that can optimize across disjoint libraries and functions. Weld
exposes a lazily-evaluated API where diverse functions can submit their
computations in a simple but general intermediate representation that captures
their data-parallel structure. It then optimizes data movement across these
functions and emits efficient code for diverse hardware. Weld can be integrated
into existing frameworks such as Spark, TensorFlow, Pandas and NumPy without
changing their user-facing APIs. We demonstrate that Weld can speed up
applications using these frameworks by up to 29x.
