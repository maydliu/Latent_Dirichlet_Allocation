Title:
Analog electromagnetically induced transparency for circularly polarized  wave using three dimensional chiral metamaterials
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a three
dimensional metamaterial that can motivate electromagnetic induced transparency
(EIT) by using circular polarized wave as stimulations. The unit cell consists
of a pair of metallic strips printed on both sides of the printed circuit board
(PCB), where a conductive cylinder junction is used to connect the metal strips
by drilling a hole inside the substrate. When a right circularly polarized wave
is incident, destructive interference is excited between meta-atoms of the 3D
structure, the transmission spectrum demonstrates a sharp transparency window.
A coupled oscillator model and an electrical equivalent circuit model are
applied to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the coupling mechanism in
the EIT-like metamaterial. Analysis in detail shows the EIT window's amplitude
and frequency are modulated by changing the degree of symmetry breaking. The
proposed metamaterial may achieve potential applications in developing chiral
slow light devices.
