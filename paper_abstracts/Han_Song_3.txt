Title:
Classification of Neurological Gait Disorders Using Multi-task Feature  Learning
Abstract: As our population ages, neurological impairments and degeneration of the
musculoskeletal system yield gait abnormalities, which can significantly reduce
quality of life. Gait rehabilitative therapy has been widely adopted to help
patients maximize community participation and living independence. To further
improve the precision and efficiency of rehabilitative therapy, more objective
methods need to be developed based on sensory data. In this paper, an
algorithmic framework is proposed to provide classification of gait disorders
caused by two common neurological diseases, stroke and Parkinson's Disease
(PD), from ground contact force (GCF) data. An advanced machine learning
method, multi-task feature learning (MTFL), is used to jointly train
classification models of a subject's gait in three classes, post-stroke, PD and
healthy gait. Gait parameters related to mobility, balance, strength and rhythm
are used as features for the classification. Out of all the features used, the
MTFL models capture the more important ones per disease, which will help
provide better objective assessment and therapy progress tracking. To evaluate
the proposed methodology we use data from a human participant study, which
includes five PD patients, three post-stroke patients, and three healthy
subjects. Despite the diversity of abnormalities, the evaluation shows that the
proposed approach can successfully distinguish post-stroke and PD gait from
healthy gait, as well as post-stroke from PD gait, with Area Under the Curve
(AUC) score of at least 0.96. Moreover, the methodology helps select important
gait features to better understand the key characteristics that distinguish
abnormal gaits and design personalized treatment.
