Title:
Smith-Purcell Radiation from Low-Energy Electrons
Abstract: Recent advances in the fabrication of nanostructures and nanoscale features
in metasurfaces offer a new prospect for generating visible, light emission
from low energy electrons. In this paper, we present the experimental
observation of visible light emission from low-energy free electrons
interacting with nanoscale periodic surfaces through the Smith-Purcell (SP)
effect. SP radiation is emitted when electrons pass in close proximity over a
periodic structure, inducing collective charge motion or dipole excitations
near the surface, thereby giving rise to electromagnetic radiation. We
demonstrate a controlled emission of SP light from nanoscale gold gratings with
periodicity as small as 50 nm, enabling the observation of visible SP radiation
by low energy electrons (1.5 to 6 keV), an order of magnitude lower than
previously reported. We study the emission wavelength and intensity dependence
on the grating pitch and electron energy, showing agreement between experiment
and theory. Further reduction of structure periodicity should enable the
production of SP-based devices that operate with even slower electrons that
allow an even smaller footprint and facilitate the investigation of quantum
effects for light generation in nanoscale devices. A tunable light source
integrated in an electron microscope would enable the development of novel
electron-optical correlated spectroscopic techniques, with additional
applications ranging from biological imaging to solid-state lighting.
