Title:
SCNN: An Accelerator for Compressed-sparse Convolutional Neural Networks
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a fundamental technology
for machine learning. High performance and extreme energy efficiency are
critical for deployments of CNNs in a wide range of situations, especially
mobile platforms such as autonomous vehicles, cameras, and electronic personal
assistants. This paper introduces the Sparse CNN (SCNN) accelerator
architecture, which improves performance and energy efficiency by exploiting
the zero-valued weights that stem from network pruning during training and
zero-valued activations that arise from the common ReLU operator applied during
inference. Specifically, SCNN employs a novel dataflow that enables maintaining
the sparse weights and activations in a compressed encoding, which eliminates
unnecessary data transfers and reduces storage requirements. Furthermore, the
SCNN dataflow facilitates efficient delivery of those weights and activations
to the multiplier array, where they are extensively reused. In addition, the
accumulation of multiplication products are performed in a novel accumulator
array. Our results show that on contemporary neural networks, SCNN can improve
both performance and energy by a factor of 2.7x and 2.3x, respectively, over a
comparably provisioned dense CNN accelerator.
