Title:
Fault-Tolerant Entity Resolution with the Crowd
Abstract: In recent years, crowdsourcing is increasingly applied as a means to enhance
data quality. Although the crowd generates insightful information especially
for complex problems such as entity resolution (ER), the output quality of
crowd workers is often noisy. That is, workers may unintentionally generate
false or contradicting data even for simple tasks. The challenge that we
address in this paper is how to minimize the cost for task requesters while
maximizing ER result quality under the assumption of unreliable input from the
crowd. For that purpose, we first establish how to deduce a consistent ER
solution from noisy worker answers as part of the data interpretation problem.
We then focus on the next-crowdsource problem which is to find the next task
that maximizes the information gain of the ER result for the minimal additional
cost. We compare our robust data interpretation strategies to alternative
state-of-the-art approaches that do not incorporate the notion of
fault-tolerance, i.e., the robustness to noise. In our experimental evaluation
we show that our approaches yield a quality improvement of at least 20% for two
real-world datasets. Furthermore, we examine task-to-worker assignment
strategies as well as task parallelization techniques in terms of their cost
and quality trade-offs in this paper. Based on both synthetic and crowdsourced
datasets, we then draw conclusions on how to minimize cost while maintaining
high quality ER results.
