Title:
Robust Face Recognition using Local Illumination Normalization and  Discriminant Feature Point Selection
Abstract: Face recognition systems must be robust to the variation of various factors
such as facial expression, illumination, head pose and aging. Especially, the
robustness against illumination variation is one of the most important problems
to be solved for the practical use of face recognition systems. Gabor wavelet
is widely used in face detection and recognition because it gives the
possibility to simulate the function of human visual system. In this paper, we
propose a method for extracting Gabor wavelet features which is stable under
the variation of local illumination and show experiment results demonstrating
its effectiveness.
