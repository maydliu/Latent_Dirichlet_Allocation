Title:
Sparkle Vision: Seeing the World through Random Specular Microfacets
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reproducing the world lighting from a
single image of an object covered with random specular microfacets on the
surface. We show that such reflectors can be interpreted as a randomized
mapping from the lighting to the image. Such specular objects have very
different optical properties from both diffuse surfaces and smooth specular
objects like metals, so we design special imaging system to robustly and
effectively photograph them. We present simple yet reliable algorithms to
calibrate the proposed system and do the inference. We conduct experiments to
verify the correctness of our model assumptions and prove the effectiveness of
our pipeline.
