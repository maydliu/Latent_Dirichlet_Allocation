Title:
Software Cognitive Information Measure based on Relation Between  Structures
Abstract: Cognitive complexity measures quantify human difficulty in understanding the
source code based on cognitive informatics foundation. The discipline derives
cognitive complexity on a basis of fundamental software factors i.e, inputs,
outputs, and internal processing architecture. An approach to integrating
Granular Computing into the new measure called Structured Cognitive Information
Measure or SCIM. The proposed measure unifies and re-organizes complexity
factors analogous to human cognitive process. However, according to the
methodology of software and the scope of the variables, Information Complexity
Number(ICN) of variables is depended on change of variable value and cognitive
complexity is measured in several ways. In this paper, we define the Scope
Information Complexity Number (SICN) and present the cognitive complexity based
on functional decomposition of software, including theoretical validation
through nine Weyuker's properties.
