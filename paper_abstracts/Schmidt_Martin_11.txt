Title:
(Co)recursion in Logic Programming: Lazy vs Eager
Abstract: CoAlgebraic Logic Programming (CoALP) is a dialect of Logic Programming
designed to bring a more precise compile-time and run-time analysis of
termination and productivity for recursive and corecursive functions in Logic
Programming. Its second goal is to introduce guarded lazy (co)recursion akin to
functional theorem provers into logic programming. In this paper, we explain
lazy features of CoALP, and compare them with the loop-analysis and eager
execution in Coinductive Logic Programming (CoLP). We conclude by outlining the
future directions in developing the guarded (co)recursion in logic programming.
