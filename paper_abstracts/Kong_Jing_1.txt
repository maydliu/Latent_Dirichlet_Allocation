Title:
Exploring Low Internal Reorganization Energies for Silicene Nanoclusters
Abstract: High-performance materials rely on small reorganization energies to
facilitate both charge separation and charge transport. Here, we performed DFT
calculations to predict small reorganization energies of rectangular silicene
nanoclusters with hydrogen-passivated edges denoted by H-SiNC. We observe that
across all geometries, H-SiNCs feature large electron affinities and highly
stabilized anionic states, indicating their potential as n-type materials. Our
findings suggest that fine-tuning the size of H-SiNCs along the zigzag and
armchair directions may permit the design of novel n-type electronic materials
and spinctronics devices that incorporate both high electron affinities and
very low internal reorganization energies.
