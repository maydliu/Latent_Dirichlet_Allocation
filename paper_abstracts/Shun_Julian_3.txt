Title:
Parallel Local Graph Clustering
Abstract: Graph clustering has many important applications in computing, but due to
growing sizes of graphs, even traditionally fast clustering methods such as
spectral partitioning can be computationally expensive for real-world graphs of
interest. Motivated partly by this, so-called local algorithms for graph
clustering have received significant interest due to the fact that they can
find good clusters in a graph with work proportional to the size of the cluster
rather than that of the entire graph. This feature has proven to be crucial in
making such graph clustering and many of its downstream applications efficient
in practice. While local clustering algorithms are already faster than
traditional algorithms that touch the entire graph, they are sequential and
there is an opportunity to make them even more efficient via parallelization.
In this paper, we show how to parallelize many of these algorithms in the
shared-memory multicore setting, and we analyze the parallel complexity of
these algorithms. We present comprehensive experiments on large-scale graphs
showing that our parallel algorithms achieve good parallel speedups on a modern
multicore machine, thus significantly speeding up the analysis of local graph
clusters in the very large-scale setting.
