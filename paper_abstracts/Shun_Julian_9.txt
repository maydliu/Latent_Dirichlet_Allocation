Title:
Greedy Sequential Maximal Independent Set and Matching are Parallel on  Average
Abstract: The greedy sequential algorithm for maximal independent set (MIS) loops over
the vertices in arbitrary order adding a vertex to the resulting set if and
only if no previous neighboring vertex has been added. In this loop, as in many
sequential loops, each iterate will only depend directly on a subset of the
previous iterates (i.e. knowing that any one of a vertices neighbors is in the
MIS or knowing that it has no previous neighbors is sufficient to decide its
fate). This leads to a dependence structure among the iterates. If this
structure is shallow then running the iterates in parallel while respecting the
dependencies can lead to an efficient parallel implementation mimicking the
sequential algorithm.
In this paper, we show that for any graph, and for a random ordering of the
vertices, the dependence depth of the sequential greedy MIS algorithm is
polylogarithmic (O(log^2 n) with high probability). Our results extend previous
results that show polylogarithmic bounds only for random graphs. We show
similar results for a greedy maximal matching (MM). For both problems we
describe simple linear work parallel algorithms based on the approach. The
algorithms allow for a smooth tradeoff between more parallelism and reduced
work, but always return the same result as the sequential greedy algorithms. We
present experimental results that demonstrate efficiency and the tradeoff
between work and parallelism.
