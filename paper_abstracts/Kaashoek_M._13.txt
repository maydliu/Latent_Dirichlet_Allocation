Title:
Discrete skew selfadjoint canonical systems and the isotropic Heisenberg  magnet model
Abstract: A discrete analog of a skew selfadjoint canonical (Zakharov-Shabat or AKNS)
system with a pseudo-exponential potential is introduced. For the corresponding
Weyl function the direct and inverse problem are solved explicitly in terms of
three parameter matrices. As an application explicit solutions are obtained for
the discrete integrable nonlinear equation corresponding to the isotropic
Heisenberg magnet model. State space techniques from mathematical system theory
play an important role in the proofs.
