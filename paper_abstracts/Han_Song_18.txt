Title:
Towards Approximate Model Checking DC and PDC Specifications
Abstract: DC has proved to be a promising tool for the specification and verification
of functional requirements on the design of hard real-time systems. Many works
were devoted to develop effective techniques for checking the models of hard
real-time systems against DC specifications. DC model checking theory is still
evolving and yet there is no available tools supporting practical verifications
due to the high undecidability of calculus and the great complexity of model
checking. Present situation of PDC model checking is much worse than the one of
DC model checking. In view of the results so far achieved, it is desirable to
develop approximate model checking techniques for DC and PDC specifications.
This work was motivated to develop approximate techniques checking automata
models of hard real-time systems for DC and PDC specifications. Unlike previous
works which only deal with decidable formulas, we want to develop approximate
techniques covering whole DC and PDC formulas. The first results of our work,
namely, approximate techniques checking real-time automata models of systems
for LDI and PLDI specifications, are described in this paper.
