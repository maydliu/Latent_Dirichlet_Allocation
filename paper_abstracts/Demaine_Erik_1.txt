Title:
Push-Pull Block Puzzles are Hard
Abstract: This paper proves that push-pull block puzzles in 3D are PSPACE-complete to
solve, and push-pull block puzzles in 2D with thin walls are NP-hard to solve,
settling an open question by Zubaran and Ritt. Push-pull block puzzles are a
type of recreational motion planning problem, similar to Sokoban, that involve
moving a `robot' on a square grid with $1 \times 1$ obstacles. The obstacles
cannot be traversed by the robot, but some can be pushed and pulled by the
robot into adjacent squares. Thin walls prevent movement between two adjacent
squares. This work follows in a long line of algorithms and complexity work on
similar problems. The 2D push-pull block puzzle shows up in the video games
Pukoban as well as The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, giving another
proof of hardness for the latter. This variant of block-pushing puzzles is of
particular interest because of its connections to reversibility, since any
action (e.g., push or pull) can be inverted by another valid action (e.g., pull
or push).
