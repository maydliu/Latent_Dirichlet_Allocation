Title:
Truly Sub-cubic Algorithms for Language Edit Distance and RNA Folding  via Fast Bounded-Difference Min-Plus Product
Abstract: It is a major open problem whether the $(\min,+)$-product of two $n\times n$
matrices has a truly sub-cubic (i.e. $O(n^{3-\epsilon})$ for $\epsilon>0$) time
algorithm, in particular since it is equivalent to the famous
All-Pairs-Shortest-Paths problem (APSP) in $n$-vertex graphs. Some restrictions
of the $(\min,+)$-product to special types of matrices are known to admit truly
sub-cubic algorithms, each giving rise to a special case of APSP that can be
solved faster. In this paper we consider a new, different and powerful
restriction in which all matrix entries are integers and one matrix can be
arbitrary, as long as the other matrix has "bounded differences" in either its
columns or rows, i.e. any two consecutive entries differ by only a small
amount. We obtain the first truly sub-cubic algorithm for this
bounded-difference $(\min,+)$-product (answering an open problem of Chan and
Lewenstein).
Our new algorithm, combined with a strengthening of an approach of L.~Valiant
for solving context-free grammar parsing with matrix multiplication, yields the
first truly sub-cubic algorithms for the following problems: Language Edit
Distance (a major problem in the parsing community), RNA-folding (a major
problem in bioinformatics) and Optimum Stack Generation (answering an open
problem of Tarjan).
