Title:
The only regular inclines are distributive lattices
Abstract: An incline is an additively idempotent semiring in which the product of two
elements is always less than or equal to either factor. This paper proves that
the only regular inclines are distributive lattices, which also implies that
there is no noncommutative regular incline.
