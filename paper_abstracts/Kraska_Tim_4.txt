Title:
The End of a Myth: Distributed Transactions Can Scale
Abstract: The common wisdom is that distributed transactions do not scale. But what if
distributed transactions could be made scalable using the next generation of
networks and a redesign of distributed databases? There would be no need for
developers anymore to worry about co-partitioning schemes to achieve decent
performance. Application development would become easier as data placement
would no longer determine how scalable an application is. Hardware provisioning
would be simplified as the system administrator can expect a linear scale-out
when adding more machines rather than some complex sub-linear function, which
is highly application specific.
In this paper, we present the design of our novel scalable database system
NAM-DB and show that distributed transactions with the very common Snapshot
Isolation guarantee can indeed scale using the next generation of RDMA-enabled
network technology without any inherent bottlenecks. Our experiments with the
TPC-C benchmark show that our system scales linearly to over 6.5 million
new-order (14.5 million total) distributed transactions per second on 56
machines.
