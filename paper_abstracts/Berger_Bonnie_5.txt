Title:
Entropy-scaling search of massive biological data
Abstract: Many datasets exhibit a well-defined structure that can be exploited to
design faster search tools, but it is not always clear when such acceleration
is possible. Here, we introduce a framework for similarity search based on
characterizing a dataset's entropy and fractal dimension. We prove that
searching scales in time with metric entropy (number of covering hyperspheres),
if the fractal dimension of the dataset is low, and scales in space with the
sum of metric entropy and information-theoretic entropy (randomness of the
data). Using these ideas, we present accelerated versions of standard tools,
with no loss in specificity and little loss in sensitivity, for use in three
domains---high-throughput drug screening (Ammolite, 150x speedup), metagenomics
(MICA, 3.5x speedup of DIAMOND [3,700x BLASTX]), and protein structure search
(esFragBag, 10x speedup of FragBag). Our framework can be used to achieve
"compressive omics," and the general theory can be readily applied to data
science problems outside of biology.
