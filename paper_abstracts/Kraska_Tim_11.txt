Title:
The Expected Optimal Labeling Order Problem for Crowdsourced Joins and  Entity Resolution
Abstract: In the SIGMOD 2013 conference, we published a paper extending our earlier
work on crowdsourced entity resolution to improve crowdsourced join processing
by exploiting transitive relationships [Wang et al. 2013]. The VLDB 2014
conference has a paper that follows up on our previous work [Vesdapunt et al.,
2014], which points out and corrects a mistake we made in our SIGMOD paper.
Specifically, in Section 4.2 of our SIGMOD paper, we defined the "Expected
Optimal Labeling Order" (EOLO) problem, and proposed an algorithm for solving
it. We incorrectly claimed that our algorithm is optimal. In their paper,
Vesdapunt et al. show that the problem is actually NP-Hard, and based on that
observation, propose a new algorithm to solve it. In this note, we would like
to put the Vesdapunt et al. results in context, something we believe that their
paper does not adequately do.
