Title:
Tupleware: Redefining Modern Analytics
Abstract: There is a fundamental discrepancy between the targeted and actual users of
current analytics frameworks. Most systems are designed for the data and
infrastructure of the Googles and Facebooks of the world---petabytes of data
distributed across large cloud deployments consisting of thousands of cheap
commodity machines. Yet, the vast majority of users operate clusters ranging
from a few to a few dozen nodes, analyze relatively small datasets of up to a
few terabytes, and perform primarily compute-intensive operations. Targeting
these users fundamentally changes the way we should build analytics systems.
This paper describes the design of Tupleware, a new system specifically aimed
at the challenges faced by the typical user. Tupleware's architecture brings
together ideas from the database, compiler, and programming languages
communities to create a powerful end-to-end solution for data analysis. We
propose novel techniques that consider the data, computations, and hardware
together to achieve maximum performance on a case-by-case basis. Our
experimental evaluation quantifies the impact of our novel techniques and shows
orders of magnitude performance improvement over alternative systems.
