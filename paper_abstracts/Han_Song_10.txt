Title:
Generate Image Descriptions based on Deep RNN and Memory Cells for  Images Features
Abstract: Generating natural language descriptions for images is a challenging task.
The traditional way is to use the convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract
image features, followed by recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate
sentences. In this paper, we present a new model that added memory cells to
gate the feeding of image features to the deep neural network. The intuition is
enabling our model to memorize how much information from images should be fed
at each stage of the RNN. Experiments on Flickr8K and Flickr30K datasets showed
that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art models with higher BLEU
scores.
