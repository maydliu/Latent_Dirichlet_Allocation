Title:
False arrhythmia alarm reduction in the intensive care unit
Abstract: Research has shown that false alarms constitute more than 80% of the alarms
triggered in the intensive care unit (ICU). The high false arrhythmia alarm
rate has severe implications such as disruption of patient care, caregiver
alarm fatigue, and desensitization from clinical staff to real life-threatening
alarms. A method to reduce the false alarm rate would therefore greatly benefit
patients as well as nurses in their ability to provide care. We here develop
and describe a robust false arrhythmia alarm reduction system for use in the
ICU. Building off of work previously described in the literature, we make use
of signal processing and machine learning techniques to identify true and false
alarms for five arrhythmia types. This baseline algorithm alone is able to
perform remarkably well, with a sensitivity of 0.908, a specificity of 0.838,
and a PhysioNet/CinC challenge score of 0.756. We additionally explore dynamic
time warping techniques on both the entire alarm signal as well as on a
beat-by-beat basis in an effort to improve performance of ventricular
tachycardia, which has in the literature been one of the hardest arrhythmias to
classify. Such an algorithm with strong performance and efficiency could
potentially be translated for use in the ICU to promote overall patient care
and recovery.
