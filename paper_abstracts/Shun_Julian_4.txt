Title:
Sorting with Asymmetric Read and Write Costs
Abstract: Emerging memory technologies have a significant gap between the cost, both in
time and in energy, of writing to memory versus reading from memory. In this
paper we present models and algorithms that account for this difference, with a
focus on write-efficient sorting algorithms. First, we consider the PRAM model
with asymmetric write cost, and show that sorting can be performed in
$O\left(n\right)$ writes, $O\left(n \log n\right)$ reads, and logarithmic depth
(parallel time). Next, we consider a variant of the External Memory (EM) model
that charges $\omega > 1$ for writing a block of size $B$ to the secondary
memory, and present variants of three EM sorting algorithms (multi-way
mergesort, sample sort, and heapsort using buffer trees) that asymptotically
reduce the number of writes over the original algorithms, and perform roughly
$\omega$ block reads for every block write. Finally, we define a variant of the
Ideal-Cache model with asymmetric write costs, and present write-efficient,
cache-oblivious parallel algorithms for sorting, FFTs, and matrix
multiplication. Adapting prior bounds for work-stealing and
parallel-depth-first schedulers to the asymmetric setting, these yield parallel
cache complexity bounds for machines with private caches or with a shared
cache, respectively.
