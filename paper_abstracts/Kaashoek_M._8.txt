Title:
Krein systems and canonical systems on a finite interval: accelerants  with a jump discontinuity at the origin and continuous potentials
Abstract: This paper is devoted to connections between accelerants and potentials of
Krein systems and of canonical systems of Dirac type, both on a finite
interval. It is shown that a continuous potential is always generated by an
accelerant, provided the latter is continuous with a possible jump
discontinuity at the origin. Moreover, the generating accelerant is uniquely
determined by the potential. The results are illustrated on pseudo-exponential
potentials. The paper is a continuation of the earlier paper of the authors [1]
dealing with the direct problem for Krein systems.
