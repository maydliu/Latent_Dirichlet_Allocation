Title:
Layered black-box, behavioral interconnection perspective and  applications to the problem of communication with fidelity criteria, Part II:  stationary sources satisfying ψ-mixing criterion
Abstract: Theorems from Part 1 of this paper are generalized to {\psi}-mixing sources
in this paper. Application to Markoff chains and order m Markoff chains is
presented. The main result is the generalization of Theorem 1 in Part 1.
