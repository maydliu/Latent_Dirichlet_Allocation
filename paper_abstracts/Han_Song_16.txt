Title:
A Security Protocol for the Identification and Data Encrypt Key  Management of Secure Mobile Devices
Abstract: In this paper, we proposed an identification and data encrypt key manage
protocol that can be used in some security system based on such secure devices
as secure USB memories or RFIDs, which are widely used for identifying persons
or other objects recently. In general, the default functions of the security
system using a mobile device are the authentication for the owner of the device
and secure storage of data stored on the device. We proposed a security model
that consists of the server and mobile devices in order to realize these
security features. In this model we defined the secure communication protocol
for the authentication and management of data encryption keys using a private
key encryption algorithm with the public key between the server and mobile
devices. In addition, we was performed the analysis for the attack to the
communication protocol between the mobile device and server. Using the
communication protocol, the system will attempt to authenticate the mobile
device. The data decrypt key is transmitted only if the authentication process
is successful. The data in the mobile device can be decrypted using the key.
Our analysis proved that this Protocol ensures anonymity, prevents replay
attacks and realizes the interactive identification between the security
devices and the authentication server.
