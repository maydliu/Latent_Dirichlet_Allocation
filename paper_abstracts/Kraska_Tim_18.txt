Title:
PIQL: Success-Tolerant Query Processing in the Cloud
Abstract: Newly-released web applications often succumb to a "Success Disaster," where
overloaded database machines and resulting high response times destroy a
previously good user experience. Unfortunately, the data independence provided
by a traditional relational database system, while useful for agile
development, only exacerbates the problem by hiding potentially expensive
queries under simple declarative expressions. As a result, developers of these
applications are increasingly abandoning relational databases in favor of
imperative code written against distributed key/value stores, losing the many
benefits of data independence in the process. Instead, we propose PIQL, a
declarative language that also provides scale independence by calculating an
upper bound on the number of key/value store operations that will be performed
for any query. Coupled with a service level objective (SLO) compliance
prediction model and PIQL's scalable database architecture, these bounds make
it easy for developers to write success-tolerant applications that support an
arbitrarily large number of users while still providing acceptable performance.
In this paper, we present the PIQL query processing system and evaluate its
scale independence on hundreds of machines using two benchmarks, TPC-W and
SCADr.
