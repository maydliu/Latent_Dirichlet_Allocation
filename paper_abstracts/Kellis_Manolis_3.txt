Title:
Spectral Alignment of Graphs
Abstract: Graph alignment refers to the problem of finding a bijective mapping across
vertices of two graphs such that, if two nodes are connected in the first
graph, their images are connected in the second graph. This problem arises in
many fields such as computational biology, social sciences, and computer vision
and is often cast as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP). Most standard graph
alignment methods consider an optimization that maximizes the number of matches
between the two graphs, ignoring the effect of mismatches. We propose a
generalized graph alignment formulation that considers both matches and
mismatches in a standard QAP formulation. This modification can have a major
impact in aligning graphs with different sizes and heterogenous edge densities.
Moreover, we propose two methods for solving the generalized graph alignment
problem based on spectral decomposition of matrices. We compare the performance
of proposed methods with some existing graph alignment algorithms including
Natalie2, GHOST, IsoRank, NetAlign, Klau's approach as well as a semidefinite
programming-based method over various synthetic and real graph models. Our
proposed method based on simultaneous alignment of multiple eigenvectors leads
to consistently good performance in different graph models. In particular, in
the alignment of regular graph structures which is one of the most difficult
graph alignment cases, our proposed method significantly outperforms other
methods.
