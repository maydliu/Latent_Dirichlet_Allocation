Title:
Efficient moment-based inference of admixture parameters and sources of  gene flow
Abstract: The recent explosion in available genetic data has led to significant
advances in understanding the demographic histories of and relationships among
human populations. It is still a challenge, however, to infer reliable
parameter values for complicated models involving many populations. Here we
present MixMapper, an efficient, interactive method for constructing
phylogenetic trees including admixture events using single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) genotype data. MixMapper implements a novel two-phase
approach to admixture inference using moment statistics, first building an
unadmixed scaffold tree and then adding admixed populations by solving systems
of equations that express allele frequency divergences in terms of mixture
parameters. Importantly, all features of the model, including topology, sources
of gene flow, branch lengths, and mixture proportions, are optimized
automatically from the data and include estimates of statistical uncertainty.
MixMapper also uses a new method to express branch lengths in easily
interpretable drift units. We apply MixMapper to recently published data for
HGDP individuals genotyped on a SNP array designed especially for use in
population genetics studies, obtaining confident results for 30 populations, 20
of them admixed. Notably, we confirm a signal of ancient admixture in European
populations---including previously undetected admixture in Sardinians and
Basques---involving a proportion of 20--40% ancient northern Eurasian ancestry.
