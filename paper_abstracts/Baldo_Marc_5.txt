Title:
Highly efficient, dual state emission from an organic semiconductor
Abstract: We report highly efficient, simultaneous fluorescence and phosphorescence
(74% yield) at room temperature from a single molecule ensemble of (BzP)PB
dispersed into a polymer host. The slow phosphorescence (208 ms lifetime) is
very efficient (50%) at room temperature and only possible because the
non-radiative rate for the triplet state is extremely low. The ability of an
organic molecule to function as an efficient dual state emitter at room
temperature is unusual and opens new fields of applications including the use
as broadband down-conversion emitters, optical sensors and attenuators, exciton
probes, and spin-independent intermediates for F\"orster resonant energy
transfer.
