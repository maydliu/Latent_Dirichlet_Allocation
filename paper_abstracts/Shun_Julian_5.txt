Title:
Variational Perspective on Local Graph Clustering
Abstract: Modern graph clustering applications require the analysis of large graphs and
this can be computationally expensive. In this regard, local spectral graph
clustering methods aim to identify well-connected clusters around a given "seed
set" of reference nodes without accessing the entire graph. The celebrated
Approximate Personalized PageRank (APPR) algorithm in the seminal paper by
Andersen et al. is one such method. APPR was introduced and motivated purely
from an algorithmic perspective. In other words, there is no a priori notion of
objective function/optimality conditions that characterizes the steps taken by
APPR. Here, we derive a novel variational formulation which makes explicit the
actual optimization problem solved by APPR. In doing so, we draw connections
between the local spectral algorithm of and an iterative shrinkage-thresholding
algorithm (ISTA). In particular, we show that, appropriately initialized ISTA
applied to our variational formulation can recover the sought-after local
cluster in a time that only depends on the number of non-zeros of the optimal
solution instead of the entire graph. In the process, we show that an
optimization algorithm which apparently requires accessing the entire graph,
can be made to behave in a completely local manner by accessing only a small
number of nodes. This viewpoint builds a bridge across two seemingly disjoint
fields of graph processing and numerical optimization, and it allows one to
leverage well-studied, numerically robust, and efficient optimization
algorithms for processing today's large graphs.
