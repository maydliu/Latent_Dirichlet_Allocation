Title:
FAST: A Framework to Accelerate Super-Resolution Processing on  Compressed Videos
Abstract: State-of-the-art super-resolution (SR) algorithms require significant
computational resources to achieve real-time throughput (e.g., 60Mpixels/s for
HD video). This paper introduces FAST (Free Adaptive Super-resolution via
Transfer), a framework to accelerate any SR algorithm applied to compressed
videos. FAST exploits the temporal correlation between adjacent frames such
that SR is only applied to a subset of frames; SR pixels are then transferred
to the other frames. The transferring process has negligible computation cost
as it uses information already embedded in the compressed video (e.g., motion
vectors and residual). Adaptive processing is used to retain accuracy when the
temporal correlation is not present (e.g., occlusions). FAST accelerates
state-of-the-art SR algorithms by up to 15x with a visual quality loss of
0.2dB. FAST is an important step towards real-time SR algorithms for ultra-HD
displays and energy constrained devices (e.g., phones and tablets).
