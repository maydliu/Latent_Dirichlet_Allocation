Title:
Coalgebraic Logic Programming: from Semantics to Implementation
Abstract: Coinductive definitions, such as that of an infinite stream, may often be
described by elegant logic programs, but ones for which SLD-refutation is of no
value as SLD-derivations fall into infinite loops. Such definitions give rise
to questions of lazy corecursive derivations and parallelism, as execution of
such logic programs can have both recursive and corecursive features at once.
Observational and coalgebraic semantics have been used to study them
abstractly. The programming developments have often occurred separately and
have usually been implementation-led. Here, we give a coherent semantics-led
account of the issues, starting with abstract category theoretic semantics,
developing coalgebra to characterise naturally arising trees, and proceeding
towards implementation of a new dialect, CoALP, of logic programming,
characterised by guarded lazy corecursion and parallelism.
