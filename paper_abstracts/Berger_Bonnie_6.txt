Title:
Ancient human genomes suggest three ancestral populations for  present-day Europeans
Abstract: We sequenced genomes from a $\sim$7,000 year old early farmer from Stuttgart
in Germany, an $\sim$8,000 year old hunter-gatherer from Luxembourg, and seven
$\sim$8,000 year old hunter-gatherers from southern Sweden. We analyzed these
data together with other ancient genomes and 2,345 contemporary humans to show
that the great majority of present-day Europeans derive from at least three
highly differentiated populations: West European Hunter-Gatherers (WHG), who
contributed ancestry to all Europeans but not to Near Easterners; Ancient North
Eurasians (ANE), who were most closely related to Upper Paleolithic Siberians
and contributed to both Europeans and Near Easterners; and Early European
Farmers (EEF), who were mainly of Near Eastern origin but also harbored
WHG-related ancestry. We model these populations' deep relationships and show
that EEF had $\sim$44% ancestry from a "Basal Eurasian" lineage that split
prior to the diversification of all other non-African lineages.
