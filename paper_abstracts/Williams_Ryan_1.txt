Title:
The Orthogonal Vectors Conjecture for Branching Programs and Formulas
Abstract: In the Orthogonal Vectors (OV) problem, we wish to determine if there is an
orthogonal pair of vectors among $n$ Boolean vectors in $d$ dimensions. The OV
Conjecture (OVC) posits that OV requires $n^{2-o(1)}$ time to solve, for all
$d=\omega(\log n)$. Assuming the OVC, optimal time lower bounds have been
proved for many prominent problems in $P$.
We prove that OVC is true in several computational models of interest:
* For all sufficiently large $n$ and $d$, OV for $n$ vectors in $\{0,1\}^d$
has branching program complexity $\tilde{\Theta}(n\cdot \min(n,2^d))$. In
particular, the lower bounds match the upper bounds up to polylog factors.
* OV has Boolean formula complexity $\tilde{\Theta}(n\cdot \min(n,2^d))$,
over all complete bases of $O(1)$ fan-in.
* OV requires $\tilde{\Theta}(n\cdot \min(n,2^d))$ wires, in formulas
comprised of gates computing arbitrary symmetric functions of unbounded fan-in.
Our lower bounds basically match the best known (quadratic) lower bounds for
any explicit function in those models. Analogous lower bounds hold for many
related problems shown to be hard under OVC, such as Batch Partial Match, Batch
Subset Queries, and Batch Hamming Nearest Neighbors, all of which have very
succinct reductions to OV.
The proofs use a certain kind of input restriction that is different from
typical random restrictions where variables are assigned independently. We give
a sense in which independent random restrictions cannot be used to show
hardness, in that OVC is false in the "average case" even for $AC^0$ formulas:
* For every fixed $p \in (0,1)$ there is an $\epsilon_p > 0$ such that for
every $n$ and $d$, OV instances where input bits are independently set to $1$
with probability $p$ (and $0$ otherwise) can be solved with $AC^0$ formulas of
size $O(n^{2-\epsilon_p})$, on all but a $o_n(1)$ fraction of instances.
