Title:
Structural Resolution: a Framework for Coinductive Proof Search and  Proof Construction in Horn Clause Logic
Abstract: Logic programming (LP) is a programming language based on first-order Horn
clause logic that uses SLD-resolution as a semi-decision procedure. Finite
SLD-computations are inductively sound and complete with respect to least
Herbrand models of logic programs. Dually, the corecursive approach to
SLD-resolution views infinite SLD-computations as successively approximating
infinite terms contained in programs' greatest complete Herbrand models.
State-of-the-art algorithms implementing corecursion in LP are based on loop
detection. However, such algorithms support inference of logical entailment
only for rational terms, and they do not account for the important property of
productivity in infinite SLD-computations. Loop detection thus lags behind
coinductive methods in interactive theorem proving (ITP) and term-rewriting
systems (TRS).
Structural resolution is a newly proposed alternative to SLD-resolution that
makes it possible to define and semi-decide a notion of productivity
appropriate to LP. In this paper, we prove soundness of structural resolution
relative to Herbrand model semantics for productive inductive, coinductive, and
mixed inductive-coinductive logic programs.
We introduce two algorithms that support coinductive proof search for
infinite productive terms. One algorithm combines the method of loop detection
with productive structural resolution, thus guaranteeing productivity of
coinductive proofs for infinite rational terms. The other allows to make lazy
sound observations of fragments of infinite irrational productive terms. This
puts coinductive methods in LP on par with productivity-based observational
approaches to coinduction in ITP and TRS.
