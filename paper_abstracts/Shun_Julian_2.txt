Title:
Improved Parallel Construction of Wavelet Trees and Rank/Select  Structures
Abstract: Existing parallel algorithms for wavelet tree construction have a work
complexity of $O(n\log\sigma)$. This paper presents parallel algorithms for the
problem with improved work complexity. Our first algorithm is based on parallel
integer sorting and has either $O(n\log\log n\lceil\log\sigma/\sqrt{\log
n\log\log n}\rceil)$ work and polylogarithmic depth, or
$O(n\lceil\log\sigma/\sqrt{\log n}\rceil)$ work and sub-linear depth. We also
describe another algorithm that has $O(n\lceil\log\sigma/\sqrt{\log n} \rceil)$
work and $O(\sigma+\log n)$ depth. We then show how to use similar ideas to
construct variants of wavelet trees (arbitrary-shaped binary trees and multiary
trees) as well as wavelet matrices in parallel with lower work complexity than
prior algorithms. Finally, we show that the rank and select structures on
binary sequences and multiary sequences, which are stored on wavelet tree
nodes, can be constructed in parallel with improved work bounds, matching those
of the best existing sequential algorithms for constructing rank and select
structures.
