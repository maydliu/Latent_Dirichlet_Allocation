Title:
Potential Errors and Test Assessment in Software Product Line  Engineering
Abstract: Software product lines (SPL) are a method for the development of variant-rich
software systems. Compared to non-variable systems, testing SPLs is extensive
due to an increasingly amount of possible products. Different approaches exist
for testing SPLs, but there is less research for assessing the quality of these
tests by means of error detection capability. Such test assessment is based on
error injection into correct version of the system under test. However to our
knowledge, potential errors in SPL engineering have never been systematically
identified before. This article presents an overview over existing paradigms
for specifying software product lines and the errors that can occur during the
respective specification processes. For assessment of test quality, we leverage
mutation testing techniques to SPL engineering and implement the identified
errors as mutation operators. This allows us to run existing tests against
defective products for the purpose of test assessment. From the results, we
draw conclusions about the error-proneness of the surveyed SPL design paradigms
and how quality of SPL tests can be improved.
